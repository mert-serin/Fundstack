# Fundstack

This projects contains Fundstack's iOS Challenge. 

Usually I use Marshal for parsing JSON but in this project I have to use CoreData so Codable would be perfect fit.

I don't want to add external libraries for network requests or images so I worked with Apple's default network manager. I usually use Alamofire for network requests and Nuke or Kingfisher for showing images from URL

I had time more than 2 hours I probably add Timer for textfield so it would act like Netflix's search, it wouldn't request every key pressed, waits like 0.5 seconds then it searches new company.

Project uses Swift 4.2
